# Program

 A program is a set of instructions which performs operations on data.
So without data instructions cannot be performed.

# Data Structures

 The way you organize the data.
In the mean memory during execution time of a program that is data structure.
So how you keep the data here so that it can be best utilized by the program .

# Need oF Recursion

most of the operations that are implemented on these data structures are basically defined and recursion and they
are also implemented without recursion using loops until the next thing recursion is usually felt as
it inefficient because it uses stack internally.
It is not much useful for solving large size problems then still we study recursion what is the reason
C there is something called problem solving and programming so distraught do different things.
Problem solving is a different programming is different.
Mostly student tried to mix them.
They think that if they understand programming they learn problem solving.
Problem solving is different and programming is different.
So programming can be learned in just a few days but problem solving is a lifetime work.
Programming means the syntax languages anyone of the language that if you know the features that are
sufficient then problem solving.
You should be good at mathematics then if you are solving a problem solution you will be giving in mathematics
and mathematics have recursion mathematics it doesn't have loops.
Mathematics have recursion.
So your solution will be mostly in the form of recursion so every programming language supports recursion.
