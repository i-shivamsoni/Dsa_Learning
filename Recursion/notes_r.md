# NOTES RECURSION

recursive function is a function which  calls itself (So a function inside function).
So if a function is calling itself then it is Scalise a recursive function.
the funtion calls itself repeatatively  so it will be forming an infinite loop so to terminate the function there always should a condition which terminates the function.
There are two phases in recursion

- One is a calling phase
- other one is returning phase
