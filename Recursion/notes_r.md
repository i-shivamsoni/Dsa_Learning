# NOTES RECURSION

recursive function is a function which is calling itself.
So if a function is calling itself then it is Scalise a recursive function.
So a function inside that if you see it is calling itself again.
It is just like this First we call the function first time then it will call itself again call itself.
again it called itself so repeatedly it will be calling again and again.
So there must be some condition at which it must stop.

One is a calling phase other one is returning phase or I can't say that this was ascending and then
