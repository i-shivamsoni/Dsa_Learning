# NOTES RECURSION

recursive function is a function which  calls itself (So a function inside function).
So if a function is calling itself then it is Scalise a recursive function.
the funtion calls itself repeatatively  so it will be forming an infinite loop so to terminate the function there always should a condition which terminates the function.
There are two phases in recursion

- One is a calling phase
- other one is returning phase

# How Recursion uses stack

When program is runned by user, a activation record for main function is created.
total N+1 records get created for recursive function.

Recursive functions are memory consuming functions.

Use of Global & Static variables

it reduces the space.

Types of Recursion

1. Tail 
2. Head
3. Tree
4. Indirect
5. Nested
